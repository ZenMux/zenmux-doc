# Introduction

## ZenMux Overview

ZenMux is the world's first enterprise-grade model aggregation platform that offers AI model insurance services. We not only provide developers with a unified API to access leading large language models worldwide, but also automatically select the optimal model via intelligent routing algorithms and offer insurance-backed safeguards for AI output quality (coming soon), comprehensively addressing enterprise concerns about AI hallucinations and output instability.

With ZenMux, developers can call models from providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and DeepSeek through a single interface, while benefiting from intelligent routing, failover, and insurance-backed assurance services.

### Name Meaning

ZenMux is a portmanteau of Zen and Mux (Multiplexer):

::: tip Meaning of Zen (禅)
Reflects the core philosophy: reducing the complex processes of multi-model selection, risk management, and API orchestration into a minimalist experience—"one API, one SDK, one platform"—through intelligent automation. At the same time, we provide an insurance backstop to alleviate concerns about hallucinations and similar issues when using AI.
:::

::: tip Meaning of Mux (Multiplexer)
Represents the core capability: aggregating multiple AI model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, etc.) and using intelligent routing to select the model best suited to the task at hand.
:::

::: tip Product Philosophy
With a Zen mindset, harness the power of AI — thousands of models unified into one; simplicity that delivers excellence.
