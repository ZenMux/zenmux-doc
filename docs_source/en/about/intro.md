# Introduction

## ZenMux Overview

ZenMux is an enterprise-grade AI model aggregation platform that provides developers with a unified API interface to access mainstream large language model services worldwide. Through ZenMux, developers can use a single interface to call models from multiple providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, and others, while enjoying intelligent routing, failover capabilities, and insurance coverage services.

### Product Name Etymology

**ZenMux** is a combination of **Zen** and **Mux (Multiplexer)**:

**Zen** - Embodies the product's core philosophy: simplifying complex multi-model selection, risk management, and API calling processes through intelligent automation into an extremely simple experience of "one API, one SDK, one platform." It also provides insurance coverage mechanisms to reduce user concerns about issues like hallucinations when using AI.

**Mux (Multiplexer)** - Represents the product's core functionality: aggregating multiple AI model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, etc.) and using intelligent routing algorithms to select the most suitable model for current tasks from numerous options.

**Product Philosophy**: With a Zen mind, harness the power of AI â€” thousands of models unified in one place, achieving optimal results through the simplest experience.
