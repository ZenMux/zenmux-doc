# Introduction

## ZenMux Overview

ZenMux is the world’s first enterprise-grade model aggregation platform offering AI model insurance services. We not only provide developers with a unified API to access leading large language models globally, but also automatically select the optimal model through an intelligent routing algorithm and offer insurance-backed guarantees for AI output quality—addressing enterprise concerns about hallucinations and unstable quality end-to-end.

With ZenMux, developers can call models from providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and DeepSeek via a single interface, while benefiting from intelligent routing, failover, and insurance coverage.

### Product Name Explained

ZenMux is a portmanteau of Zen and Mux (Multiplexer):

::: tip Meaning of Zen
It reflects the product’s core philosophy: simplifying the complex processes of multi-model selection, risk management, and API orchestration into a minimalist experience of “one API, one SDK, one platform” through intelligent methods. At the same time, it provides an insurance safety net to reduce worries about issues like hallucinations when using AI.
:::

::: tip Meaning of Mux (Multiplexer)
It represents the product’s core capability: aggregating multiple AI model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, etc.) and selecting the most suitable model for the current task from many options via an intelligent routing algorithm.
:::

::: tip Product Philosophy
With a Zen mindset, harness the power of AI — unify thousands of models into one, and achieve optimal results through a minimalist experience.

## Key Features

### LLM Aggregation Platform

ZenMux aggregates leading closed-source and open-source large language models worldwide, providing a convenient, unified platform for developers to invoke models.

::: tip One-Stop Integration Experience
Create a single API key and use a unified API standard to call different models from different providers. No need to register across multiple platforms, manage multiple keys, or top up multiple wallets.
:::

**Key Advantages:**

- **Unified Identity Management**: One API key controls access to all providers
- **Unified Billing**: Transparent usage accounting and cost control with centralized account management
- **Rich Model Selection**: Access to the latest models from major providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and DeepSeek

### Dual-Protocol Support

ZenMux uniquely supports dual protocols, enabling developers to integrate AI models in the most familiar way.

::: tip Flexible Protocol Choices
- **OpenAI-Compatible Protocol**: Invoke all models on the platform through the OpenAI standard API
- **Anthropic-Compatible Protocol**: Invoke all models on the platform through the Anthropic standard API, integrating seamlessly with tools like Claude Code
:::

This means you can freely choose the API protocol that best fits your project requirements and team practices without worrying about differences between model providers.

### High Capacity and High Availability

We maintain ample capacity reserves for each LLM to ensure your business is not constrained by model capacity limits.

::: tip Enterprise-Grade Service Guarantees
- **High Capacity Reserves**: Nearly all models are provisioned at Tier 5 capacity quotas
- **Multi-Vendor Support**: Multiple providers are integrated for critical models
- **Automatic Failover**: When one provider is at capacity, the system automatically switches to others to prevent service interruptions
:::

Through multi-layer capacity reserves and intelligent failover, ZenMux delivers high availability for your AI applications.

### Platform-wide Model “Degradation Detection”

ZenMux is the industry’s first platform to publicly and continuously evaluate the quality of all model channels.

::: tip Transparent Quality Assurance
We regularly conduct Human Last Exam (HLE) tests across all models and channels on the platform, and both the testing process and results are open-sourced on GitHub.
:::

**Core Mechanisms:**

- **Regular Quality Checks**: Continuous monitoring of truthfulness and reliability for all model channels
- **Open and Transparent**: Full test workflows and results are public on GitHub for community oversight
- **Real-Time Leaderboard**: Results are published to the website in real time, forming a dynamic HLE leaderboard
- **Quality Traceability**: Ensures all channels and models on the platform are authentic and reliable, eliminating “degraded” models

This mechanism provides dependable quality assurance, giving you confidence when selecting models.

### AI Model Insurance Service

ZenMux is the world’s first platform to offer AI model insurance, providing a safety net for model invocation outcomes.

::: tip Innovative Insurance Mechanism
We underwrite scenarios such as poor model performance, hallucinations, and excessive latency. Through daily automated detection and payouts, we provide a quality backstop for your AI applications.
:::

**Insurance Features:**

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Covers poor performance, hallucinated outputs, and excessive response latency, among other scenarios
- **Automated Detection and Payouts**: Insurance checks run daily on platform call data, with payouts automatically settled the next day
- **Data Flywheel Value**: Insurance algorithms surface high-quality bad cases that can directly improve your AI product
- **Continuous Improvement Support**: Build a product data flywheel from insurance payout data to continuously enhance AI effectiveness

This innovative service not only safeguards your costs but also helps you accumulate valuable optimization data.

### Intelligent Model Routing

If you’re seeking the optimal balance between model quality and cost, ZenMux’s intelligent routing is the ideal choice.

::: tip Automated Optimal Selection
Based on request content and task characteristics, the system automatically selects the most suitable model—ensuring quality while minimizing cost.
:::

**Routing Advantages:**

- **Quality-Cost Balance**: Automatically selects between high-performance and cost-effective models
- **Task-Aware Matching**: Deeply analyzes request content to match the most capable model
- **Continuous Learning**: Continuously optimizes routing strategies based on historical data
- **Transparent and Controllable**: Provides detailed routing decision logs and supports custom routing rules

With intelligent routing, you don’t need to manually choose models to get the best of both worlds: affordable and effective.

### Developer-Friendly Observability

Centered on serving developers, ZenMux offers comprehensive observability and debugging capabilities.

::: tip Holistic Data Insights
Gain deep visibility into AI model usage from multiple dimensions to help you quickly pinpoint issues, optimize costs, and improve outcomes.
:::

**Core Capabilities:**

- **Detailed Log Analysis**: Full records of request and response details for every API call
- **Cost Aggregation**: Analyze cost distribution by project, model, time, and more
- **Usage Analytics**: Real-time monitoring of token usage and call frequency
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times, concurrency, and other key performance metrics
- **Model Effectiveness Comparison**: Compare output quality across different models
- **Visual Dashboards**: Intuitive charts and reports for fast situational awareness

This robust observability framework lets you fully control your AI application’s runtime state and quickly detect and resolve issues.

### Global Edge Nodes

Powered by Cloudflare’s infrastructure, ZenMux deploys distributed edge computing nodes worldwide.

::: tip Global Acceleration Network
No matter where your users are, they can call LLMs from the nearest edge node, enjoying low-latency, high-performance service.
