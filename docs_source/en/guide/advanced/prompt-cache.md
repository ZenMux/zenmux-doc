# Prompt Caching

ZenMux does not interfere with a model’s prompt caching behavior. Whether prompt caching is enabled is determined by the model provider’s default behavior and the request parameters specified by the user.

## Providers' Default Behavior

For the default prompt caching behavior of different model providers, please refer to each model’s detail page.
