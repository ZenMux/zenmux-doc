# Prompt Caching

ZenMux does not interfere with the model's prompt caching behavior. Whether prompt caching is enabled depends on the model provider's default behavior and the user's call parameters.

## Provider Default Behavior

For different model providers' default prompt caching behaviors, please refer to each model's detail page.
