# Provider Routing

ZenMux adopts a multi-provider architecture, integrating multiple providers for the same model and selecting the optimal provider through intelligent routing to ensure the best performance and availability. When calling large models via ZenMux, developers do not need to worry about the underlying provider selection logic—simply specify the model name.

## Why a Multi-Provider Architecture

In enterprise AI applications, a single-provider architecture carries significant risks:

- Service interruption risk: Provider failures can halt your business
- Performance fluctuation: Latency and throughput vary widely across providers
- Cost optimization challenges: Lack of flexible provider selection mechanisms
- Geographic limitations: A single provider may not cover global markets
- Compliance requirements: Different regions have varying rules on data storage and processing

ZenMux’s multi-provider architecture fundamentally addresses these issues, providing enterprise-grade assurance for your AI applications.

## Key Benefits

### High Availability

When a provider experiences service issues or capacity shortfalls, ZenMux automatically switches to other available providers to ensure continuity, without manual intervention.

Assurance mechanisms:

- Real-time health checks: Continuously monitor all providers’ service status
- Intelligent failover: Millisecond-level switching to backup providers
- Seamless transitions: Failover without user impact
- Multi-level redundancy: 2–3 providers for mainstream models

For detailed failover and model fallback strategies, see the Model Fallback Documentation (/guide/advanced/fallback.html).

### Performance Optimization

Providers perform differently across geographies and time windows. ZenMux uses intelligent routing to select the best provider for each request.

Performance advantages:

- Latency optimization: First token latency is a key factor in provider selection
- Throughput assurance: Dynamically adjust provider allocation under high load
- Global acceleration: Leverage Cloudflare’s edge network for low global latency
- Real-time monitoring: Continuously track performance metrics to optimize routing

### Flexible Cost Control

With a multi-provider architecture, you can flexibly select the most suitable provider based on budget and performance needs.

Cost optimization methods:

- Transparent price comparison: Real-time display of each provider’s pricing
- Easy switching: Seamlessly switch providers to optimize cost
- Demand-based routing: Control costs via provider routing configuration

## Default Routing Strategy

ZenMux uses the following default routing strategy:

::: info Intelligent Routing Principles

1. Performance first: Sort by first token latency from low to high
2. Smart switching: If the origin provider is unavailable, automatically switch to other providers

:::

This approach ensures performance while maximizing service availability.

## A Simple Way to Specify Providers

ZenMux offers a straightforward provider configuration—model name suffix syntax. You do not need a separate provider field; you can specify the provider directly in the model name.

### Syntax

```text
model_slug:provider_slug
```

### Examples

::: info Model Slug Lookup
Each model on ZenMux has a unique slug. You can find the slug on the Model List page (https://zenmux.ai/models):
![model-slug](https://cdn.marmot-cloud.com/storage/zenmux/2025/10/21/AQG0SIr/model-slug.png)
Or on a specific model’s detail page (https://zenmux.ai/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5):
![model-slug](https://cdn.marmot-cloud.com/storage/zenmux/2025/10/21/dWYxJnq/model-slug-3.png)
:::

::: info Provider Slug Lookup
Model providers on ZenMux have unique slugs. You can find a model’s provider slug on the model’s detail page (https://zenmux.ai/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5):
![provider-slug](https://cdn.marmot-cloud.com/storage/zenmux/2025/10/21/98Gc7hL/provider-slug.png)
:::

For example, to pin Claude 3.7 Sonnet to the AWS Bedrock provider, use:

```text
anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:amazon-bedrock
```

The :amazon-bedrock suffix tells ZenMux to route the request specifically to the designated provider, with no extra configuration.

::: code-group

```json [JSON Request]
{
  "model": "anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:amazon-bedrock", // [!code highlight]
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Hello, Claude!"
    }
  ]
}
```

```python [OpenAI Python SDK]
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://zenmux.ai/api/v1",
    api_key="<your_api_key>"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:amazon-bedrock",  # [!code highlight]
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude!"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Advanced Routing Configuration

For finer control, ZenMux provides full provider configuration capabilities.

### Route by Performance Metrics

Use provider.routing to sort providers by specific performance dimensions.

#### Supported Dimensions

| Dimension  | Description                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| latency    | Sort by first token latency from low to high                  |
| price      | Sort by combined price (Prompt + Completion) from low to high |

### Specify Provider List

You can explicitly set the provider list and call order to implement custom fallback behavior.

::: code-group

```json [Specify Provider Order]
{
  "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Hello!"
    }
  ],
  "provider": {
    // [!code highlight]
    "routing": {
      // [!code highlight]
      "type": "order", // [!code highlight]
      "providers": [
        // [!code highlight]
        "anthropic/anthropic_endpoint", // [!code highlight]
        "google-vertex/VertexAIAnthropic", // [!code highlight]
        "amazon-bedrock/BedrockAnthropic" // [!code highlight]
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

```python [Python SDK Example]
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://zenmux.ai/api/v1",
    api_key="<your_api_key>"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
    ],
    extra_body={
        "provider": {
            "routing": {
                "type": "order",
                "providers": [
                    "anthropic/anthropic_endpoint",
                    "google-vertex/VertexAIAnthropic",
                    "amazon-bedrock/BedrockAnthropic"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
)
```

#### Routing Behavior

When you specify a providers list, ZenMux behaves as follows:

- Sequential calls: Attempt providers in listed order
- Stop on success: Stop once any provider returns successfully
- Single provider: If only one provider is specified, ZenMux will call only that provider
- Error handling: If the specified provider returns an error, return that error directly

::: warning ⚠️ Cautions
When using custom routing strategies, ensure that the specified providers actually support the selected model; otherwise, calls may fail.
:::

## Use Cases

Different routing strategies fit different business scenarios:

| Scenario                 | Recommended Approach           | Description                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pin a single provider    | Model name suffix syntax       | Simple and direct; suitable for production with fixed providers   |
| Geographic optimization  | Specify provider list          | Choose geographically closer providers to reduce latency          |
| Cost control             | Route by price                 | Prefer providers with better pricing                              |
| Performance optimization | Route by latency or throughput | Dynamically select the best provider based on performance metrics |
| High availability        | Specify multiple providers     | Multi-provider fallback to ensure continuity                      |
| Compliance requirements  | Pin specific providers         | Choose providers that meet data compliance requirements           |
| Testing & validation     | Flexible switching             | A/B test provider performance                                     |

## FAQ

### Q: How can I see which provider was used for a specific call?

A: In the ZenMux Console (https://zenmux.ai/settings/activity), the request logs show detailed information for each request, including the model and provider used.

![Call Log Example](https://cdn.marmot-cloud.com/storage/zenmux/2025/10/21/EClzQU6/logs-provider-model.png)

### Q: Will automatic provider switching affect output consistency?

A: The same model across different providers usually produces consistent outputs because they use the same underlying model weights. Some providers may have minor response time differences.

### Q: Does the multi-provider architecture increase latency?

A: No. ZenMux’s routing decisions are made at millisecond scale, with negligible impact on overall latency. In fact, by intelligently selecting low-latency providers, it can reduce total response time.
