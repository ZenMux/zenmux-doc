# Cost Analysis

ZenMux provides powerful cost analysis capabilities to help you monitor and analyze API usage expenses in real time. Through the cost analysis page, you can view spending details across different dimensions, including costs categorized by model, API Key, service provider, and more, enabling you to optimize your application usage strategy and control expenses more effectively.


## 1. Cost Overview

At the top of the page, you'll find a set of statistical cards displaying key cost metrics, providing a quick overview of overall spending for the current time period.

### Available Filter Options
You can customize the query scope using the following dropdown options:
- **Time Granularity**: View data by "Month", "Day", "Hour", and other dimensions.
- **Time Range**: Displays recent periods in UTC time by default, with the option to manually select specific dates or intervals.
- **API Keys**: Filter costs generated by specific API keys.
- **Model Selection**: Choose to analyze all models or specify a particular model (e.g., `google/gemini-3-pro-preview`).

### Metric Descriptions

| Metric | Description |
|------|------|
| **Total Cost** | Total amount spent, covering all input, output, and other related fees. |
| **Input Cost** | Fees generated by input tokens. |
| **Output Cost** | Fees generated by output tokens. |
| **Other Cost** | Additional fees not related to tokens (e.g., call latency compensation, system resource consumption, etc.). |
| **Average Cost Per ...** | Average cost per request/per unit token (dynamically displayed based on context). |

## 2. Total Cost by Model

This section displays the consumption share of each model in chart form, helping you identify which models are the primary cost drivers.

- Supports horizontal comparison of usage costs across multiple models.
- Click on any item to navigate to that model's detailed cost report.
- Displays as blank if no data is available.

> ✅ Recommendation: Regularly review this section and adjust the usage frequency of high-cost, low-efficiency models as needed.

## 3. Cost Breakdown by Type

This module shows the allocation of costs across different types, such as:
- By **Model Type** (e.g., LLM, Embedding, Vision)
- By **Service Provider** (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic)
- By **Request Purpose** (e.g., chat, reasoning, image generation)

> 📊 Charts are automatically loaded and visualize the cost composition of each category, making it easy to understand spending structure at a glance.

## 4. Cost by API Key

This section lists the consumption amount corresponding to each API Key, making it convenient to manage cost attribution in multi-account team scenarios.

- Each API Key displays its corresponding total cost and usage frequency.
- Supports export to CSV or copy link to share.
- Can be combined with the "Usage" page for further analysis of specific calling behaviors.

> 🔐 Security Reminder: Do not expose API Keys. It's recommended to assign independent keys to different projects for tracking and auditing purposes.

## 5. Provider Cost View

After switching to the "Provider Cost" tab, you can view detailed cost breakdowns for each cloud service provider.

1. **Cost by Provider**
   - Displays total spending for different providers (e.g., Google, OpenAI).
   - Supports sorting and filtering for easy cost-effectiveness comparison.

2. **Provider Details**
   - Lists call details for all models under that provider, including:
     - Model name
     - Number of calls
     - Input/output token quantity
     - Cost per call
     - Total fees

> 💡 Example: If you find that a particular provider's model pricing is high, consider migrating to a more cost-effective alternative.
