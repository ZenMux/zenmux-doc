# Cost Analytics

ZenMux provides powerful cost analysis capabilities to help you monitor and analyze API usage expenses in real-time. Through the cost analysis page, you can view detailed spending across different dimensions, including costs categorized by model, API Key, service provider, and more, enabling you to better optimize your application usage strategy and control expenses.

> **Note**: The data displayed on this page does not include usage from subscription plans; it only tracks Pay As You Go usage.

## Cost Overview

At the top of the page, you'll find a set of key cost metric cards that provide a quick overview of overall spending for the current time period.

Filter Options:
- **Time Granularity**: View data by "Month", "Day", "Hour", and other dimensions.
- **Time Range**: Defaults to the most recent period in UTC time; you can manually select specific dates or ranges.
- **API Keys**: Filter costs generated by specific API keys.
- **Model Selection**: Analyze all models or specify a particular model (e.g., `google/gemini-3-pro-preview`).

### Metric Descriptions

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Cost** | Total spending amount, covering all input, output, and other related costs. |
| **Input Cost** | Costs generated by input tokens. |
| **Output Cost** | Costs generated by output tokens. |
| **Other Cost** | Additional non-token-related costs (e.g., latency compensation, system resource consumption, etc.). |
| **Average Cost Per Request** | Average cost per request|
| **Average Cost Per Million Tokens** | Average cost per million tokens |

## Multi-Dimensional Analysis

### Total Cost by Model

This section displays consumption distribution across models in chart form, helping identify which models are the primary cost drivers.

1. **Cost by Provider**  
   - Displays total spending for different providers (e.g., Google, OpenAI).  
   - Supports sorting and filtering for easy cost-effectiveness comparison.

2. **Provider Details**  
   - Lists call details for all models under that provider, including: model name, number of calls, input/output token counts, cost per call, and total cost.  

> 💡 Example: If you find that a particular provider's model pricing is too high, consider migrating to a more cost-effective alternative.
