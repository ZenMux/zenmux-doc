# Billing Transparency

ZenMux uses a transparent billing system to ensure every call is precisely metered and billed. Pricing differs across models, and the same model may be priced differently across providers.

## Viewing Prices

You can view pricing for each provider on the model detail page. Every provider presents detailed billing standards, including costs for input tokens, output tokens, and special features.

For models with tiered pricing, rates are displayed by usage tiers to help you understand costs at different consumption levels.
