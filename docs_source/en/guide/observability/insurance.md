# **Insurance Compensation**

ZenMux provides a comprehensive insurance compensation system that enables you to monitor and analyze compensation instances resulting from service anomalies or performance issues in real-time. You can view aggregated compensation data, statistical charts categorized by type and model, as well as detailed compensation records, allowing you to better understand service health and optimize cost management.

---

## **Overview**

At the top of the page, key compensation metrics are displayed based on your current filter criteria:

- **Total Compensation**: The cumulative compensation amount generated within the specified time range.
- **Compensation Count**: The number of requests that triggered the compensation mechanism.
- **Average Per Compensation**: The average compensation amount per request that triggered compensation.
- **Average Compensation / Day**: The average daily compensation count calculated based on the selected time range.

---

## **Aggregate View**

Switch between the following tabs to view compensation data from different perspectives:
- **Credits of Compensation**: View compensation by credit amount
- **Times of Compensation**: View compensation by occurrence count

### **Aggregate by Compensation Type**
This chart displays the distribution of different compensation reasons, such as "Unsatisfactory Content" and "High Latency". Through this view, you can quickly identify the most common compensation types, helping pinpoint system bottlenecks or service quality issues.

---

### **Aggregate by Compensation Model**
This chart categorizes compensation by model usage, showing compensation instances generated by each model. This helps evaluate the service stability and reliability of different models, facilitating resource adjustments and optimization strategy development.

## **Compensation Details**

The table below lists all specific request records that triggered compensation, with support for filtering and viewing across multiple dimensions.

### **Filter Tabs**
Switch between different compensation categories using the following tabs:
- **Unsatisfactory Content**: Compensation triggered by substandard generated content quality.
- **High Latency**: Compensation triggered by excessive response latency.

### **Field Descriptions**
| Field | Description |
|------|------|
| **Timestamp** | The timestamp when the request occurred, accurate to the millisecond. |
| **Model** | The name of the invoked model (e.g., `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`). |
| **Input Tokens** | The number of input tokens, used to measure request complexity. |
| **Output Tokens** | The number of output tokens, reflecting the length of generated content. |
| **Cost** | The actual cost of this request (including compensation). |
| **Latency** | Request processing time (in milliseconds); high latency may trigger compensation. |
| **Throughput** | Tokens processed per second, indicating system throughput capacity. |
| **Finish** | Request completion status (e.g., `stop`, `length`, `error`, etc.). |
| **Payout** | The actual payout amount (if compensation exists). |
| **Action** | Action button to view the request details page or raw meta information. |

## **Usage Recommendations**

1. **Monitor Compensation Trends Regularly**: Use the time range filter to observe whether compensation increases over time, helping identify potential systemic risks.
2. **Focus on High-Frequency Compensation Types**: Prioritize addressing frequently occurring compensation reasons to improve overall service quality.
3. **Compare Model Performance**: Utilize the "Aggregate by Model" view to identify underperforming models and consider replacement or optimization.
4. **Analyze Specific Cases in Depth**: Click "Details" to access the request details page, where you can review original request parameters, response content, and logs to help troubleshoot root causes.
