# Request Logs

ZenMux provides a comprehensive logging system to help you monitor and analyze all API call records in real time. With logging, you can review detailed information for each request—including token usage, cost, performance metrics, and more—so you can better optimize your application and control costs.

## Viewing Logs

### Logs UI

![logs](https://cdn.marmot-cloud.com/storage/zenmux/2026/02/04/hRufjb7/C1924254-C6BA-4BE9-A8EA-37ED8DA28955.png)

On the **Logs** page in the console, you can view detailed records for all API calls. The UI provides powerful filtering and analysis capabilities:

**Filters:**

- **Time range (Time)**: Select a specific date range to view historical records
- **API key (API Keys)**: Filter logs by different API keys for easier multi-project management
- **Request ID search (Request)**: Enter a request ID to quickly locate a specific request
- **Provider (Provider)**: Filter by provider, such as Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.
- **Model (Model)**: Filter by model to quickly find call records for a specific model
- **Finish reason (Finish Reason)**: Filter by finish reason, such as `stop`, `end_turn`, `max_tokens`, etc.

**Log list fields:**

| Field Name      | Description                                                                 |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Timestamp`     | Timestamp when the request was initiated                                    |
| `Model`         | Model name used (e.g., openai/gpt-5.2, anthropic/claude-opus-4.5)           |
| `Input Tokens`  | Number of input tokens; click to view a detailed token breakdown            |
| `Output Tokens` | Number of output tokens                                                     |
| `Cost`          | Cost of this call (USD)                                                     |
| `Latency`       | Request latency (ms)                                                        |
| `Throughput`    | Throughput, tokens generated per second (tokens per second)                 |
| `Finish`        | Completion status (e.g., `end_turn`, `tool_use`, `stop`, `max_tokens`, `length`) |
| `Action`        | Action button; click **Details** to view full request and response details  |

::: tip Viewing token details

![logs](https://cdn.marmot-cloud.com/storage/zenmux/2026/02/04/oB9QNOh/20260204163548.jpg)

Click the number in the Input Tokens column to open a popover showing a detailed token breakdown, including:

- `prompt`: Base input tokens
- `input_cache_read`: Tokens read from cache
- `input_cache_write`: Tokens written to cache
- `input_cache_write_5_min`: 5-minute cache write
- `input_cache_write_1_h`: 1-hour cache write

This helps you understand cache usage and optimize your caching strategy.

::: tip Viewing billing details

Hover over the number in the Cost column to open a popover showing billing details. What you see depends on your account type:

**Pay-as-you-go users (Pay As You Go):**
![logs](https://cdn.marmot-cloud.com/storage/zenmux/2026/02/04/sxs9R74/20260204163702.jpg)

Shows a detailed breakdown by wallet category and settlement status:

- `Purchased Credits`: Funds topped up by the user; used when Reward Credits are insufficient
- `Reward Credits`: Credits such as top-up bonuses or insurance compensation; deducted first
- Status tags (e.g., `Settled`) indicate that the charge has been settled

**Subscription users (Subscription):**
![logs](https://cdn.marmot-cloud.com/storage/zenmux/2026/02/04/LsEH46N/20260204163622.jpg)
Shows the message: `Included in your subscription usage - no separate charge.`

### Request Details page

![logs](https://cdn.marmot-cloud.com/storage/zenmux/2026/02/04/z7KBWgU/20260204163740.jpg)

Click **Details** on any log entry to view the full information for that call. The details page is split into two sections:

#### Left: Conversation content

The left panel displays the complete request and response content, split into **Request** and **Response** sections. Each section includes:

- **User message**: The input sent by the user
- **System message**: System prompt (if any)
- **Assistant message**: The response generated by the model
- **Tool calls**: If tool calling is used, the tool inputs and outputs are shown

**Display mode toggle:**

The left panel supports two display modes, switchable via the tabs at the top:

- **Pretty mode (formatted)**: Presents the conversation in a formatted, readable view. Messages are grouped by role, and code is syntax-highlighted for easier reading and understanding.
- **JSON mode (raw data)**: Shows the complete raw request and response data in JSON format, including all technical details—ideal for development debugging and troubleshooting.

**Data source switching in JSON mode:**

In JSON mode, you can further choose which stage of data to view:

- **Request:**
  - `User -> ZenMux`: The original request sent by the user to ZenMux
  - `ZenMux -> Origin`: The request ZenMux forwarded to the upstream provider
- **Response:**
  - `ZenMux -> User`: The response returned by ZenMux to the user
  - `Origin -> ZenMux`: The original response returned by the upstream provider to ZenMux

::: tip Switching display modes
Choose the display mode that best fits your needs:

- Use **Pretty mode** when reviewing the conversation and analyzing interaction quality
- Use **JSON mode** when debugging your API integration or troubleshooting technical issues, and switch data sources as needed to inspect request/response details at different stages
  :::

#### Right: Metrics and metadata

The right panel shows detailed technical metrics and metadata:

**Model information (Model Information):**

- **Model**: Model name used
- **Provider**: Model provider

**Token counting (Token Counting):**

- **Input Tokens:**
  - `prompt`: Prompt token count
  - `input_cache_write`: Tokens written to cache
  - `input_cache_write_5_min`: 5-minute cache write token count
  - `input_cache_write_1_h`: 1-hour cache write token count
  - `input_cache_read`: Tokens read from cache
- **Output Tokens:**
  - `completion`: Generated content token count
  - `internal_reasoning`: Internal reasoning token count
  - `audio`: Audio token count

**Requests counting (Requests Counting):**

- `web_search`: Number of web search requests

**Multimodalities counting (Multimodalities Counting):**

- `image`: Number of images processed

**Performance metrics (Performance Metrics):**

- **First Token Latency (ms)**: Time from sending the request to receiving the first token (ms)
- **Generation Time (ms)**: Time to generate the full response (ms)
- **Throughput (tps)**: Token generation rate (tokens per second)

**Raw metadata (Raw Metadata):**

- Displays the full request metadata in JSON format
- Supports one-click copying of the JSON data

### Raw Meta Information

In addition to the console UI, you can also use the raw Meta information returned by the API to understand cost details for a call. Below is a complete example:
