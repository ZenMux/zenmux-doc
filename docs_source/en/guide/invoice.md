# Download Invoices

ZenMux provides comprehensive invoice support for all top-up and subscription payments. This guide will help you understand how to fill in invoice information, view, and download invoices to meet corporate reimbursement and financial audit requirements.

## How to Download Invoices

Downloading an invoice involves two steps:

1. **Fill in Invoice Information** - Enter billing details when topping up or subscribing
2. **Download Invoice** - View and download the corresponding invoice from billing history

## Step 1: Fill in Invoice Information

When making a top-up or subscription payment, you need to fill in your invoice information first. The system will generate an invoice based on the details you provide.

### Fill in Invoice Information on the Top-up Page

When you make a **Pay As You Go top-up** or **subscription plan payment**, you can see the **Invoice Details** section at the bottom of the payment page:

1. Click the **"Edit"** button in the **Invoice Details** section

2. Fill in the following invoice information in the popup form:

### Modify Saved Invoice Information

If you have previously saved invoice information, the system will automatically use the previously saved information for your next top-up or subscription. To modify it:

1. Click the **"Edit"** button in the **Invoice Details** section on the payment page
2. Update the fields you need to modify
3. Click **"Save billing info"** to save the updates

The system will remember your most recently saved invoice information for convenient future use.
