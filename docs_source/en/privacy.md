## II. How We Store and Protect Personal Information

1. We will store and/or transfer your personal information in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Personal information collected and generated by us about you may be transferred and/or stored outside your country/region of residence. Generally, all data (including Personal Information and User Content) uploaded or transferred by you to us related to your account and product services will be stored in Singapore. In carrying out such international transfers, we will follow the requirements of applicable laws and regulations, and will require such overseas recipients of your personal information to ensure that the standard of protection provided by such overseas recipients of personal information is comparable to that under applicable laws and regulations of your country/region of residence.

To safeguard your personal information, we are dedicated to exploiting various security technologies and supporting management systems to reduce the risks of your personal information being divulged, corrupted or lost, misused, revised, accessed or disclosed without authorisation, strictly restricting access to the data center and using private network channels and network proxies.

4. We have appointed staff responsible for personal information protection. We have also developed a relevant internal control system, and adopted the authorisation principle of minimal and sufficient use by employees who may have access to your personal information. We systematically monitor the data processing activities of our employees.

5. We have formulated emergency plans for personal information security incidents and regularly arrange relevant internal personnel to receive emergency response training and to conduct emergency exercise, so that they are able to master the responsibilities of their position and the strategies and procedures for emergency response. If, unfortunately, any personal information security incident occurs, we will act in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and, where required, inform you in a timely manner of the basic information and possible impact of the security incident, measures taken or to be taken by us, suggestions for you to take precautions on your own and to reduce risks, remedial measures taken for you, etc.

6. While we take information security measures to protect your personal information, please also ensure that you keep your account login name and other identifiers in a safe manner. When you use the services, we will identify you by your account login name and other identifiers. Once you divulge such information, you may suffer from losses and adverse legal consequences against you. If you find that your account login name and/or other identifiers may be or have been divulged, please contact us immediately so that we may take appropriate measures to avoid or mitigate the relevant losses.

7. Upon our customer's termination of using the services, we will stop collecting your personal information, except as otherwise provided by applicable laws and regulations or required by regulatory authorities. If the retention period of relevant personal information required by applicable laws and regulations has not expired or there are other circumstances under which the relevant personal information shall not or need not be deleted according to applicable laws and regulations, we will continue to retain such personal information while ceasing to process such personal information, except for storage and taking necessary security protection measures. If we cease operations, we will promptly stop collecting your personal information, and will inform you of the cessation, and delete or anonymize the personal information held by us.

## IV. How We Share Your Personal Information

### 1. Sharing of your personal information for providing services

Your personal information will be shared by us with third parties. We may share your information with third parties for commercial purposes, for example to enable them to provide services on our behalf or to assist us in analyzing how the services are used.

Such third parties include (a) our affiliates and other partners, (b) our third party service providers and contractors, (c) our authorised agents, (d) our professional advisers, (e) law enforcement agencies, courts, governmental bodies and regulatory authorities to whom we may be legally required to make disclosures, and (f) any individuals or entities involved in any merger, acquisition, corporate reorganisation, financing or similar transaction involving the sale of all or part of our assets.

## V. How We Use Cookie, Beacon, Proxy and Other Technologies

For easier user experience, we may identify you through small data files when you visit our website or use any service provided by us, which could save you the trouble of repeatedly entering login information or help to determine whether your account is safe. Such data files may include cookies, flash cookies or other local storages provided by your browser or linked applications (collectively referred to as "cookies"). Please understand that some of our services are only available through cookies. You can change the cookie acceptance level or refuse our cookies if it is allowed by your browsers or browser add-ons. The "Help" section of the toolbar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as flash cookies, by changing the add-on settings or by visiting the website of the developer. However, such actions may under certain circumstances affect your secure access to our website or use of services provided by us.

In addition, our website may include some electronic images (referred to as "single-pixel GIF files" or "web beacons"). Through web beacons, a website can help to calculate the number of users visiting the webpage or access some cookies. We will use web beacons to collect data regarding your webpage browsing activities, such as webpage addresses visited by you, the reference pages previously visited by you, your browser environment and your display settings.

If, where applicable, you use any service provided by any third party other than us through our website or platform, to keep your account secure and for safer user experience, we may use a private network protocol and proxy technology (referred to as "private network channel"). With the private network channel, we can help you identify high risk sites that are already known to us and thus reduce risks associated with phishing and account breaches arising from those sites. The private network channel can also better protect the common rights and interests of you and third parties by preventing lawbreakers from tampering with the services expected by you and third parties, including advertisements injection and illegal contents tampering caused by unsecure routers and illegal base stations. Meanwhile, we may obtain and preserve information about your computer, such as IP address, hardware ID and the location of the pages you visited.

## VI. How You Can Exercise Your Rights regarding Your Personal Information

We will take appropriate technical measures to ensure that you can access, update and correct your personal information and exercise your other rights to personal information provided under applicable laws and regulations. Please note that if you opt out of certain types of data collection or use, you may not be able to use all features of our services. You may carry out the relevant operations by contacting us via the following email address.

When we cooperate with third party organizations to provide services, to the extent required by applicable laws and regulations, your use of such third party organization's services will be subject to its published privacy policy or other terms and conditions (if any). Please read the relevant policies and terms carefully; if you have any questions, you may consult the third party organization which provides the services you use.

If you have any questions about this Policy or have any complaints or comments on the processing of your personal information, please contact us via the following channels:

**Email address: support@zenmux.ai**
